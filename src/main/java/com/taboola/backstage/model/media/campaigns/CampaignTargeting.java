/**
 * <p>
 *    Targeting your campaigns to the right segment helps you get the most out of your
 *    campaigns. In the following document you will find information regarding the targeting
 *    abilities supported by the API.
 *    <br> The supported targeting options are:
 *    <br> 1. Geo Targeting - You can target specific geographic areas - like countries or
 *    regions within a specific country. You can also target more granularly - by postal
 *    code. For example, you can run your local store campaigns only in places you
 *    have physical stores, helping you spend your budget wisely and attract relevant
 *    customers.
 *    <br> 2. Platform Targeting (include only) - You can choose on which devices your
 *    campaign items will appear. Platform targeting can be useful if you have different
 *    product or service offerings for users that browse from different platforms. For
 *    example, if youâ€™re offering a mobile app, it would make sense to target mobile
 *    devices only.
 *    <br> 3. Publisher Targeting (exclude only) - You can block specific publishers from
 *    serving your campaign.
 *    <br> 4. OS Targeting - The campaign can be targeted for specific operation system
 *    <br> 5. Connectivity Type Targeting (include only) - The campaign can be targeted
 *    for specific connectivity type (e.g. WIFI)
